## About
[Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This simulation of Conway's Game Of Life is made using python with pygame.

## Rules Of Conway's Game Of Life
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Installation
1. Download the repository

3. Click on random squares to change the state of that square
4. Hit Enter to start/pause the simulation

## Tools Used
